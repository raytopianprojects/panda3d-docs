   The DirectGUI Python modules
   ----------------------------

   Panda3D comes with a set of tools for the creation of a graphical interface
   for any program. The DirectGui system is used to create buttons, labels, text
   entries, and frames within the program. All of these items can be decorated
   with text, images, and 3D graphics. Commands may be associated with these
   items as well. Since these objects inherit from the :class:`.NodePath` class,
   anything done to a NodePath may be done to them, such as
   :meth:`~.NodePath.show()`/:meth:`~.NodePath.hide()`,
   :meth:`~.NodePath.set_pos()`, posInterval(), and so on. Also, since DirectGui
   objects are by default parented to the node :py:obj:`~builtins.aspect2d`,
   they will stay on the screen no matter how the user navigates through the
   world.

   You can specify the parent nodepath for any DirectGUI object using the
   parent= argument. You can use :py:obj:`base.aspect2d` for center-oriented
   placement, and a2dTopLeft or a2dBottomRight respectively. The Y coordinate
   should be left 0, because it's useless in the 2D space. The Z coordinate goes
   from -1 to 1, and X depends on the aspect ratio, by the default 4:3 it's from
   -1.3333 to 1.3333. The other aspect2d variants don't scale the numbers, just
   offset them.

   The direct-gui-edit option in the Config.prc file allows the user to use the
   middle mouse button to move around widgets, and resize them while holding the
   control key; this is very useful to lay a screen out during development. If
   you need to turn this ability off for an individual object, set its
   ``enableEdit`` keyword parameter to False.

   All of the DirectGui objects are constructed in a similar way:

   .. code-block:: python

      from direct.gui.DirectGui import *
      myObject = Directxxxxxx(keyword=value, keyword=value, ...)

   Each DirectGui object may contain any of four fundamental pieces that
   determine its appearance. There may be an optional text, an optional geom, an
   optional image, and an optional frame.

   A DirectGui's text label may be any arbitrary text string, and whatever text
   string you supply is automatically created using the :ref:`onscreentext`
   interface and centered on the object. You can specify the text string using
   the ``text`` keyword. You can also specify further parameters to control the
   appearance or placement of the text using the form ``text_parameter``, where
   ``parameter`` is any valid keyword to the :ref:`onscreentext` constructor.

   A DirectGui's geom can be any NodePath that you design, to represent the
   appearance of the gui object. Typically, this will be a model that you
   created via the program ``egg-texture-cards``. This little program takes a
   png or other picture and turns it into an egg.
   See :ref:`automatic-texture-animation` for more details.
   Using this interface, you can completely customize the look of the DirectGui
   object to suit your needs. You can specify the geom object using the ``geom``
   keyword, and like the text parameter, you can also control the geom's
   placement using keywords like ``geom_parameter``.

   The image is less often used. It is the filename of a texture image (or an
   already-loaded Texture object). It is intended for displaying a simple
   texture image for which you don't already have a model created via
   ``egg-texture-cards``. A default card will be created to display this
   texture, with a bounding box of (-1, 0, -1) to (1, 0, 1); that is, a square
   with sides of length 2 units, centered on the origin. You can position and
   scale this card with the keywords ``image_pos`` and ``image_scale``. See also
   :ref:`onscreenimage`.

   Finally, the DirectGui may have a frame created for it. This is typically a
   gray rectangular background with an optional bevel. There are a handful of
   different frame styles; you can use the ``relief`` keyword to select from one
   of the available styles; your choices are SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, or RIDGE.
   You can also specify ``relief = None`` to avoid creating a frame polygon
   altogether (this is commonly done when you have specified your own geom
   object with the ``geom`` keyword).

   The overall size of the DirectGui object is controlled with the ``frameSize``
   keyword. This is a four-tuple of floating-point numbers of the form (left,
   right, bottom, top), which specifies the bounding box region of the DirectGui
   object. That is, the lower-left corner will be at position (left, 0, bottom),
   and the upper-right will be at (right, 0, top). Note that these values
   represent coordinates from the origin of the frame. Setting the frameSize to
   (-0.1, 0.1, -0.1, 0.1), for instance, will create a box, 0.2 units wide and
   0.2 units in height, with 0,0 being the center of the frame located at
   ``pos`` on the screen.

   The ``frameSize`` keyword is optional. If you omit it, the default frameSize
   is computed based on the bounding box of the text, geom, and/or image that
   you have specified.

   The following is a list of keywords that are typically available to DirectGui
   objects of all kinds. Individual kinds of DirectGUI objects may add more
   options to this list, but these keywords are not repeated on each of the
   following pages, for brevity:

   Remember that the axes for Panda3D use x for left and right, y for in and out
   of the screen, and z for up and down. An object's frame is always in the
   background of the object. The geom, if any, is shown in front of the frame,
   and text is shown in front of the geom.

   It is possible to change most of these values after object creation, using:

   .. code-block:: python

      myDirectObject['keyword'] = value

   Most properties can be updated in this way, although position and other
   transform-related values cannot be updated via the keyword parameters--
   attempts to update them will silently fail. Instead, use the NodePath methods
   to change the object's transform.

   Some types of updates, such as changing the text or the geom, may also change
   the size of the object. If you change any of these properties after the
   object has been created, it is necessary to tell the object to re-determine
   its size:

   .. code-block:: python

      myDirectObject.resetFrameSize()

   If you don't do this, you may find, for example, that a button isn't
   clickable because it believes it has a zero-width frame.

   To permanently remove a DirectGUI object, you should use the method:

   .. code-block:: python

      myDirectObject.destroy()

   It is not sufficient to simply call :meth:`~.NodePath.removeNode()`, since
   the DirectGUI system adds a number of messenger hooks that need to be cleaned
   up. However, if you have a hierarchy of DirectGUI objects, for instance a
   number of buttons parented to a frame, it is sufficient to call destroy()
   only on the topmost object; it will propagate downwards.

.. only:: cpp

   Since DirectGUI is implemented in Python, it is useless to C++ programmers.
   However, there is another GUI system, PGui, that forms the foundation of
   DirectGUI and is in fact implemented in C++.

   Let's take a look at some PGui functions.

   The PGui C++ modules
   --------------------

   [PGButton]

   .. code-block:: cpp

      #include "pgButton.h"

   with PGButton you can create a freely definable clickable button.

   It can hold four different states:

   ready
      The default state of an untouched button
   pressed
      The pressed state (the user clicked on it)
   roll over
      When the user hovers over the button without clicking
   inactive
      Disabled state

   Example usage, creating a texture for each state:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      PT(PGButton) my_button;
      my_button = new PGButton("MyButton");
      my_button->setup("Button", 0.1);
      PT(Texture) button_ready = TexturePool::load_texture("button.png");
      PT(Texture) button_rollover = TexturePool::load_texture("button_active.png");
      PT(Texture) button_pressed = TexturePool::load_texture("button_pressed.png");
      PT(Texture) button_inactive = TexturePool::load_texture("button_inactive.png");

      // PGFrameStyle is a powerful way to change the appearance of the button:
      PGFrameStyle my_style = my_button->get_frame_style(0); // frame_style(0): ready state
      my_style.set_type(PGFrameStyle::T_flat);

      my_style.set_texture(button_ready);    my_button->set_frame_style(0, my_style);
      my_style.set_texture(button_rollover); my_button->set_frame_style(1, my_style);
      my_style.set_texture(button_pressed);  my_button->set_frame_style(2, my_style);
      my_style.set_texture(button_inactive); my_button->set_frame_style(3, my_style);

      NodePath button_np = window->get_aspect_2d().attach_new_node(my_button);
      button_np.set_scale(0.1);

      // Setup callback function
      framework.define_key(my_button->get_click_event(MouseButton::one()), "button press", &GUI_Callback_Button_Clicked, my_button);

   An example of a callback function:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      static void GUI_Callback_Button_Clicked(const Event *ev, void *data) {
        PGButton *button = (PGButton *)data;
        // Your action here
        printf("%s has been pressed.\n", button->get_name().c_str());
      }

   [PGSliderBar]

   .. code-block:: cpp

      #include "pgSliderBar.h"

   A simple sliderbar.

   This slider basically has four components:

   * The thumb button. This is the sliding part.

   * The slider. This is the 'rail' the thumb button slides along.

   * The left button. User can click on it to slide the thumb button to the left.

   * The right button. User can click on it to slide the thumb button to the right.

   Using default initialisation, none of these components are textured.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      PT(PGSliderBar) slider = new PGSliderBar("MySliderBar");

      // Setup, feeding the constructor with (bool vertical,float length,float width,float bevel)
      slider->setup_slider(false, 0.1, 0.1, 0); // 'rail' properties
      slider->set_range(0,1);
      slider->set_value(0.5);

      // Setup scroll bar (the 'moving thumb button' including left and right button)
      slider->setup_scroll_bar(false, 0.35, 0.05, false);
      NodePath slider_np = window->get_aspect_2d().attach_new_node(Slider);
      slider_np.set_pos(0, 0, 0);

   (work in progress, more to come soon.)
